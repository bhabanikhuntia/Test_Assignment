            <h4>About Us</h4>
            <p>When you use the phrase "in university" you are saying to the audience that 
                the person currently attends the university (according to enrollment status)<br>
                 or has attended the university at some point in their life. 
                The word "university" represents a broader geographic location in cases like these.</p>
